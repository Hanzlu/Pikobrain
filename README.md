# Pikobrain
A 16-bit 'Operating System' written in assembly language.

Supposed to be small, but usable. Only 6kB of machine code.

Makes use of BIOS interrupts, and should be able to run on any computer with BIOS.

Has a decent text editor, an assembler*, file manipulation commands and more.

All numbers are written in hexadecimal using uppercase letters.
