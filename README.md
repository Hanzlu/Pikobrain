# Pikobrain
A 16-bit 'Operating System' written in assembly language.

Supposed to be small, but usable. Only 6kB of machine code.

Makes use of BIOS interrupts, and should be able to run on any computer with BIOS.

Has a decent text editor, an assembler*, file manipulation commands and more.

All numbers are written in hexadecimal using uppercase letters.

Tested on an HP ProLiant ML110 G5 (1GB RAM, 80GB HDD, Intel Core 2 Duo, from 2009)

Read the pikomanual file to get started with the system.

Inside the OS, type 'e0101' to get the list of commands.
